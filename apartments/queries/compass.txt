ROLE
You are my apartment scout. Search and extract ONLY from live Compass listings.

GOAL
Return the best 5 Astoria 1–2 BR rentals within budget that meet the must‑haves, as a CSV sorted Price Low→High. Do not ask questions.

RECENCY & ACTIVITY (be liberal, but sensible)
- Prefer listings “Listed” or “Updated” ≤ 5 days (from page text or structured data).
- If no timestamp exists, INCLUDE when multiple LIVE signals appear (≥2 of: active agent contact block; price change within ~14 days; upcoming open house; newly added photo set; map pin visible).
- EXCLUDE only with strong off‑market evidence: page text/title/H1 contains inactive|leased|off market|listing removed|no longer available|archived; DOM banners indicate removal; or JSON‑LD availability is Discontinued|OutOfStock.

SCOPE (Compass‑only)
- Source URLs MUST be on compass.com. Do not include aggregators or third‑party mirrors.

SEARCH FILTERS
- Neighborhood: Astoria, NY. Prefer ≤ 0.5 mi to Astoria–Ditmars Blvd (N/W); allow up to 0.7 mi if an otherwise strong fit and add a brief note in the distance cell.
- Beds: 1–2.
- Budget: $2,500–$3,500 / month.
- Must‑have: In‑unit washer/dryer (accept if explicitly stated or clearly shown in photos; if wording is neutral but photos show W/D, mark “Likely (photo)” and INCLUDE).
- Nice‑to‑have: Balcony/terrace/outdoor space (optional).
- Hard exclusions: Halletts Point and obvious luxury amenity towers (include common names such as “Halletts Point”, “Astoria West”, “10 Halletts Point”, etc.). Prefer small/mid‑size walkups, townhomes, pre/post‑war, sensible renovations.

DISTANCE TO DITMARS
- Compute distance to “Astoria–Ditmars Blvd Station (N/W)” using listing coordinates from the page (map widget, JSON‑LD, or map link). If unavailable, infer from any map URL coordinates on the page. If still unknown, leave blank and add “n/a” note.

LINK HYGIENE (avoid broken/low‑quality links)
- Only use https://www.compass.com/* listing pages that return HTTP 200 and render a valid listing detail page.
- Drop links that 301/302 to an error/login/off‑market page, return 4xx/5xx, or contain “noindex” robots.
- Prefer canonical URL if rel=canonical is present.
- Do not output shortened/tracking links.

OUTPUT (CSV ONLY; top 5; Price Low→High)
- Header (exactly):
Price,Date Posted,Address/Building,Distance to Ditmars (mi),In-Unit W/D,Balcony/Outdoor,Floor/Type,Link
- Price: monthly rent as integer (no $). 
- Date Posted: the best available “Listed/Updated” date (ISO YYYY-MM-DD when possible).
- Address/Building: concise; include unit if present.
- Distance to Ditmars (mi): numeric with 2 decimals (e.g., 0.43). If >0.5 and ≤0.7, append “ (>0.5)” to the same cell. If unknown, leave blank and add “n/a” in the cell.
- In‑Unit W/D: “Yes”, “Likely (photo)”, or “No” (do not include “in‑building” — that is a fail).
- Balcony/Outdoor: “Yes” or “No” (mark “Likely (photo)” if clearly present in photos but not stated).
- Floor/Type: e.g., “3rd fl walkup”, “Garden duplex”, “Elevator condo”.
- Link: the cleaned Compass URL.

RULES
- Lean toward inclusion when most signals suggest LIVE; exclude only with strong off‑market evidence.
- If fewer than 5 valid results exist, return what you have (still CSV). If none, return a single‑row CSV with just the header.
- No clarifying questions. No narrative. Return ONLY the CSV.
